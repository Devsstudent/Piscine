## I feel alone
	In life we are alone, we can make friends etc but finally we die alone
	So just think of whats is the best for me, not for the others ..

## Work
* Set Work Time like 30 - 5 break
* Paper to notes ideas, don't copy something if not understood
* Find attractive things to do !
* Thinks for the future

## Social
* Be open to others, takl about shit, but just pass time faster when not busy
* Getting numbers may not mean anything, sure we gonna have contact
* But today message is borring, maybe vocal or call is better, set a place and meet
* Otherwise groups are very good to things we are in social motion (when no social network)
