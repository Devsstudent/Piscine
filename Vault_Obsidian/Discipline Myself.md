Book : The War of Art (Break Through the Blocks and Win You Inner Creative Battles)

## Resistance mission : Keep things exacly as they are.

Intro : When we doesn't resist to something (you know this feelings) is just to get the reward of doing something like being busy but not efficiently ..


### 1)Motivation and Discipline 
Dopamine is created with motivation to get things done !
Discpine is the thing of doing thing when you doesnt really want to do it but you judge it better for your future

The +1 framework of decision making
Imagine 2 rounds 
one forward witch as every 1 km go a +1 panel
one backward witch as every 1 km got a -1 panel
Each decision could give you a +1 or a -1
So when you have to choose just focus on +1 to get motivated
(like morning ahahahhaha)

Not caring what we feel but what we do

1)Take action

2)Remove tentation, setup a good productivity environnement for example

3)Become The Master and the Slave
He who cannot obey itself will be commanded

Twofold strategy :
Im 2 people , Current me and Futur me
Curremt me thinking about task of future me doesnt caring because its not the current me
And the future me just do the task on the calendar

4)Identify you why
Just focus on why doing it before burning your hands

5) build a discipline pratice
Take cold shower etc etc 

Bonus : Win battle against procratstination
1) Become aware of delaying moment : recurent alram of what im doing at this time is it positive or negative
2) Reclaim you intention: why you are doing it, to be happy [[Notes of Unsicouscious mind]]
3) Define your objective: what to do to move toward my goal
Rest stay rest : Motion stay motion
5) Start a timer : to motivate and just act fast (logical just doing the things now is the better way to achieve it !)
6) Begin, act, start what you want to do (start small, get traction and dont stop)
