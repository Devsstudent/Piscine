Unconscious mind feel primal emotions : like Hapiness, Fear, Survival
So create artificial motivators to  create or reduce these primal emotions

Just love what you do and unconscious will follow

Associate task with the feeling of finishing it when doing it to loove

Same goes for negative and failure to get more motivation to get it

1) do your task
2) think about your motivator doing the task to keep doing it
3) Imagine sucess emotion of what this task will get you
4) 
Conditional you brain few minues by day

I could use my ego too, like engaging my ego in any task will motivate more the unconscious mind in positive and negative cause we touch at our ego

Do hard things, not little things giving little dopamine just focus on hard things with the unconscious working on 
Full focus on task and goals no let place to someother distractions or your losing you unconscious motivation a b
